So this is the 23rd of october and you've come to the realisation that you can't go on ignoring this like you have. 
This is just a note to remind myself of the fact that starting today this repository will have my complete full and
undivided attention for a minimum duration of 2 hours each day. Alongwith you'll also have to complete a minimum of 
4 problems each day on codeforces with understanding. These will include problems A to D of any past contests, a new
algorithm at the minimum from cp-algorithms each day alongwith solving atleast 3 leetcode problems of medium to hard 
level by yourself each day. if you are to seek help in some problem, it will not count towards this quota of 3. Just 
carry on and hope to do something well in life. You just can't carry on like this.
